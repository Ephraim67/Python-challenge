###  Function Definition:

```python
def longest_value(d: dict):
    """Using a dictionary, find the longest value."""
```

* This defines a function named `longest_value` that takes **one argument `d`**, which is expected to be a **dictionary**.
* The goal is to find and return the **longest value** (by character length) from the dictionary.



###  Step 1: Check if the dictionary is empty

```python
if not d:
    return None
```

* If the dictionary is empty (`{}`), there's nothing to find â€” so the function returns `None`.



###  Step 2: Use `max()` to find the key with the longest value

```python
longest_key = max(d, key=lambda k: len(d[k]))
```

* `max()` is used to **find the key** in the dictionary whose **value has the longest length**.
* `key=lambda k: len(d[k])` tells Python to compare based on the **length of each value**.

For example, in this dictionary:

```python
fruits = {'fruit': 'apple', 'color': 'green'}
```

* Length of `'apple'` = 5
* Length of `'green'` = 5

Theyâ€™re equal, but since `max()` returns the **first max** in case of a tie, it returns `'fruit'`.



###  Step 3: Return the actual value

```python
return d[longest_key]
```

* It returns the **value** (not the key!) that is the longest.



### ðŸ“Œ Final Output

```python
fruits = {'fruit': 'apple', 'color': 'green'} 
print(longest_value(fruits))   # Output: 'apple'
```

Even though both `"apple"` and `"green"` are the same length, `"apple"` comes first in the dictionary â€” so it is returned.
